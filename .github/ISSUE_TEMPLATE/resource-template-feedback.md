# RESOURCE TEMPLATE LABEL OR ID

[ The resource template label is displayed at the top left of the Sinopia data entry form, and will look something like:  
UWSINOPIA WAU rdaWork monograph CAMS ]

# PROBLEM USING THE RESOURCE TEMPLATE, OR REQUESTED CHANGE

[ Some examples:
- The property template for [prop IRI or label] is set up for literals, it should be set up for URIs or lookups
- The lookup source for [prop IRI or label] is wrong, please use this lookup source instead
- [prop IRI or label] is needed in this template but it isn't here ]

# ANY OTHER RELEVANT DETAILS

[ For example, information about the resource you are describing with the template (is it the format for which the template was designed, or a different format, etc.) ]
