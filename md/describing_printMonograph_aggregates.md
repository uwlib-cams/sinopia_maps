# Pre-cataloging decisions: choosing templates for describing aggregates
ðŸš§ *DRAFT GUIDANCE DOCUMENTATION* ðŸš§

| OPTION | RECOMMENDED FOR |
|---|---|
| **[A](#option-a)** | An augmentation aggregate with only one primary expression; a collection or parallel aggregate where no more than three (primary) expressions are aggregated  |
| **[B](#option-b)** | A collection aggregate where more than three (primary) expressions are aggregated |
| **[C](#option-c)** | A collection aggregate where more than three (primary) expressions are aggregated, and a creator of one or more of the expressions or works that are aggregated is deemed useful to users; a parallel aggregate where more than three (primary) expressions are aggregated -- when describing aggregated expressions in this case, describe the original expression, if present, and at least the first derivative expression in the resource. |
| **[D](#option-d)** | **Not recommended**; only describe the aggregating expression when the same aggregating work (and hence the same aggregating expression) is manifested in multiple manifestations; consider the possible minor differences in augmenting content when determining whether two aggregating works are the same. |
| **[E](#option-e)** | ðŸš§ðŸš§ðŸš§ |

### WEMI linking
- Link a work to its expression which using the element [has expression of work](https://access.rdatoolkit.org/en-US_ala-e23bf7e1-aa3e-3e8d-874e-9a16d0cdee57)
- Link an aggregated expression to the aggregate manifestation using the element [has manifestation of expression](https://access.rdatoolkit.org/en-US_ala-36cea3ce-03c7-3286-a342-3255b55cb4f6)

<!-- - Collocate aggregating works that belong in the same work group using Work: authorized access point for work group or Work: identifier for work group. See [Toolkit guidance](https://access.rdatoolkit.org/en-US_ala-4d4d3f5b-8d94-3ee5-89d8-241a98366db4/section_y4p_p24_2fb). -->
+ Record a creator of the aggregating work using Work: creator agent of work or Work: aggregator agent or a more appropriate narrower element. See [Toolkit option](https://access.rdatoolkit.org/en-US_ala-4d4d3f5b-8d94-3ee5-89d8-241a98366db4/div_dv4_rvn_2fb).

- Do not record a creator of one or more of the works that are aggregated as a creator of the aggregating work, unless they happen to be the same agent.
